# my-cc-example
Insight Data Engineer Coding Challenge beginning in May 31st, finished by Sidi Chang.

Python 2.7.10 is used for this competition,
please install scipy and decimal packages before running this program, I do not include data-gen file but I put a small test case in this folder.

Also, please make sure the input file is under dir+/../tweet_input/tweets.txt so that the program can run properly, and you would expect to see the result in tweet_output/output.txt.

In run.sh and run_test.sh, I do not include
> pip install spicy
> pip install decimal

But I am sure if you install this two packages and run under Python 2.7, you will get the right result.

Thanks!
